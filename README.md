## Who Am I?

|-|-|-|-|

I'm a fun-loving quality-focused software engineer based in Arizona (for now :smirk:)

I am always learning something new and looking for opportunities to share those new things with others! 

### Values
- strike a balance between quality and delivery
  - _let's invest 30min now to prevent a 2hr headache 2 weeks from now_
- always moving
  - _growth-mindset_
- technical conciseness
  - _say what you mean and no more; boilerplate is the death of delivery_
- unix philosophy
  - _give me the timber and hardware, and soon you'll have a much stronger and more beautiful house than a prefab_

### Hobbies
- [writing hot takes on Medium](https://orionkindel.medium.com)
- blacksmithing
- rock climbing _(indoor mostly)_
- cars _(driving should be **fun**!)_
- personal projects
  - smart espresso machine
  - artist portfolio for my accomplished painter partner
- games _(mostly competitive, mostly smash)_

## What I expect from you, and you can expect in return
(Addressing co-workers and contributors)

### Candor & Accountability
Well-considered honesty is a gift, and accountability is an act of compassion. By holding each other accountable we can be active participants in each other's growth, and the growth of whatever project we have in common. Tell me when something isn't working, and I'll do the same.

### Mutual challenge, learning, teaching
There is a time and a place for a "go-to" or "de-facto" solution, but it's critically important that as engineers we are active in our community and stay up to pace with the changes that are happening in real-time. I am always learning, and expect you to challenge my understanding and teach me about your experience, and you can expect the same from me.

As someone who goes a bit against the grain and lives on the bleeding edge of the engineering field, it's important to me to share what I'm passionate about with people who love to learn. This is how history is made, by changing 1 mind at a time.

## Projects I'm Working on
 <!-- - [`cliply`] - fully client-side video editor in the browser (big lift, contributors welcome!) -->

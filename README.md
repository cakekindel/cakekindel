# Orion Kindel

## Who I am
### [Check out my website!](https://www.orionkindel.com)

### Values
I am all about creating software that is:
 - robust
 - correct
 - predictable
 - tested

and UI that is:
 - robust
 - correct
 - predictable
 - tested

### Experience
Definitions:
- "Confidence"
    - _Because none of these factors are truly binary, I threw a 1-10 score of roughly how comfortable I would be in an environment with this tool, and how confident I am I would be able to train others less experienced, or learn from others more experienced._
- "Familiar with"
    - _I have researched this tool enough to have a high-level understanding of its semantics and best practices._
- "Have Used"
    - _I have used this tool to solve a problem of some difficulty, and have a somewhat lower-level understanding of it. This usually also means I can effectively communicate the pros and cons of the tool with other engineers & stakeholders._
- "Could learn from another Engineer"
    - _I do not have a 100% understanding of this tool, and in a position with other engineers (of any experience), I would have something to learn from them._
- "Could teach another Engineer"
    - _I would be effective in a mentor role with this tool with less experienced engineers, where they would be able to get up to speed and effective with the tool quickly._
- "Could lead a team of Engineers unfamiliar with tool"
    - _I would be effective in a lead developer role with this tool: working with team members to establish patterns and guidelines, spearheading a greenfield project with this tool, and effectively training new engineers._
